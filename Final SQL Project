# For my Final SQL Project I downloaded a database file from Kaggle and proceeded to run the following queries.

-- Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

-- Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
-- The resulting table should show the customer's 
-- full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT invoices.InvoiceId, invoices.InvoiceDate, customers.FirstName, 
customers.LastName, invoices.BillingCountry, customers.Country
FROM customers

LEFT JOIN invoices 
ON customers.CustomerID = invoices.CustomerID
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

-- Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
-- The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, invoices.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees

LEFT JOIN chinook.customers    
ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId

LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices
ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId; 

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

-- Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

-- How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate = LIKE '2009%';

-- What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';
