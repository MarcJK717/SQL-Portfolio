# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined which artists and tracks are top 10 in danceability.

SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 10;

#Then I determined what was the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs.

SELECT AVG(danceability), popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 90
ORDER BY popularity;

#Lastly, I determined which artist released the longest song.

SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
